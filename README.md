# Title
Attendance System using Face Recognition

# Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a face recognition model using deep convolutional neural networks which can then be deployed to automatically mark attendance. The model would learn faces labelled with their roll numbers (identity of the student) and then accurately determine the roll number for a face. We aim to make the model robust against orientations of the face to ease marking of attendance for users (students).
